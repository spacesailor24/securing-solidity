# Securing Solidity

This project will serve as a repository of information pertaining to the understandings I've gained while exploring security vulnerabilities within Solidity.

The idea is to:

- Explain each vulnerability
- Provide high-level code examples, if possible
- Provide information and best practices to avoid the vulnerability
- Provide examples of the attack performed in the wild, where applicable
- Provide an implementation of the attack that could be executed for educational purposes
